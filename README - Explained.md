# README - Explained

This project asked us to create a web page that has two main functions:
1. append data as a table from a JavaScript file;
2. append only filtered 'date' data in the input box from said table.

Relevant files include:
1. static/data.js: This is the original data file used to load.  Note dates for input field must be between 1/10/2010 - 1/13/2010 because those are the parameters in this source file. 
2. static/app.js: File where I wrote code to render Table and Filtered Table upon 'Submit' click.  Comments annotated throughout this file.
3. static/index.html: HTML shell used to render the results of the JS code.  Used Bootstrap for website and styling framework.
4. static/styles.css: CSS for HTML styling.
5. Images/nasa.jpg: heading image.
6. README.md: Homework assignment instructions.
